The tools in our framework support only the analysis of time series data of packet captures. A multi-layer approach might help inform the user more concretely about the state of the network. In particular, information from intrusion detection systems, routers, and firewalls could be incorporated. In addition, an analysis of the packet contents could give useful information. However, such an approach will generally put strong limits on the scope of situations the data processing is applicable to.
