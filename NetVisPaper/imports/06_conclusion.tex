In this paper we have presented a network visualization tool to analyse and monitor network traffic. Instead of presenting single perspectives (visualizations) of the data very well (but with a limited scope), our framework delivers a variety of visualizations that complement each other and work in tandem to help an analyst obtain improved awareness of ongoing network activity through user interaction and identifying how visualizations are related to one another. We overviewed its suite of visualizations and demonstrated its usefulness with several example scenarios. In the future we intend to add more visualizations and improve the tool's usability further.
