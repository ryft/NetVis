Heatmap visualization uses a hexagonal map to display a set of communicating nodes.
The activity of a specific machine in the network is represented by the color of the 
corresponding hexagon. As the packets arrive nodes representing machines that send them
''heat up`` and as the time passes ''heat down``. Hexagonal grid is being filled in a 
compact manner - node by node.

This visualization helps a user find the machines most active in the network.
It gives a quick overview of the number of the clients and how many of them are currently active.
Presenting most commonly used protocol of every client, it lets users do some basic filtration choices easily.
It provides a method of finding out about hotspots in the network.
