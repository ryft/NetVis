It displays a graph of the distribution of some packet attribute (eg. Distribution of port ranges across all packets). 
The main graph is on a log scale useful for identifying spikes in the volume of data on some attribute interval. 
Each interval also displays some dots. The area of those dots is an actual representation of the traffic that has that certain attribute property (The dots are also color coded - a red dot is bigger than a blue dot). 
In this visualisation you can select a range for an attribute and the visualisation will apply a removable data filter that will only allow data in that range to get to the visualisations.
