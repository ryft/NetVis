The most common need in the analysis of network traffic is information on the distribution of certain features of the packets. For the graph constructed here, the user selects such a feature (e.g., ports or destination IPs). A logarithmic line graph is drawn and (as with all visualizations in the application) updated in real time. A logarithm is applied to assist in detecting spikes.

A second layer of the visualization is presented simultaneously: circles under the line graph indicate the actual distribution (without a logarithm applied) through their area. Furthermore, all lines and circles are colour-coded to give extra signals of the volume of traffic. Red elements are under heavier load.

This visualisation makes active use of the normalisers described above. It also allows the user to click-and-drag along interesting data to zoom into this area. Internally this means that a filter is applied and all visualizations show only the selected packets so that they can be analysed in more detail.
