The spinning cube is an implementation of an existing visualization tool known as the spinning cube of potential doom \cite{cube04}.
It’s displays packets as dots inside a spinning cube. Their 3D position is based on 3 packet attributes. (eg. x-axis => Source Port / y-axis => Destination Port / z-axis => Source IP). The 3 coordinates are customisable.
