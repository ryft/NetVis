The Spinning Cube is an implementation of an existing visualization tool known as the spinning cube of potential doom\footnote{See \url{www.kismetwireless.net/doomcube/}}.
It’s displays packets as dots inside a spinning cube. Their 3D position is based on 3 packet attributes. (eg. x-axis $\Rightarrow$ Source Port / y-axis $\Rightarrow$ Destination Port / z-axis $\Rightarrow$ Source IP). The 3 coordinates are customisable.
