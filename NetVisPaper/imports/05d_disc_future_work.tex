Our main avenue of future work is a more powerful data preprocessing system. Our current visualizations focus on giving the user a complete view on the network while allowing interactive filtering. However, if statistical inference is applied to the data, and historical observations are incorporated, this can help make visualizations more effective in pointing out suspicious patterns and anomalies in the data.

Further future developments will also give advanced tools for assisting users in investigating phenomena and better observing specific forms of network attack. For this, a library of applicable data filtering configurations should be available, and an adaptive data selection procedure should be offered.

Future work should also need to validate the usefulness of our application by testing it on other expert users in live environments, instead of laboratory settings only.
