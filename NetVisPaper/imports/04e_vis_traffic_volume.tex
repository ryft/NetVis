The traffic volume visualization is inspired by the `FlowScan'
graph\footnote{See \url{www.caida.org/tools/utilities/flowscan/}}.
It's realised as a stacked bar chart which displays the volume of data arriving
in each time interval, with column segment heights proportional to the total
number of packets transmitted for each protocol. This allows users to see at a
glance if a particular protocol is being exploited on the network. In addition,
the column segments are colour-coded and can be cross-referenced with a
protocol key underneath the visualization itself.

To help distinguish different protocols, colours are selected from a colour
palette which provides colours from a qualitative colour scheme.
This visualization provides a control in the right panel which lets the user
adjust the number of time intervals displayed at once.
