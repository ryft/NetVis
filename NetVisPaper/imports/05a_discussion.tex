The main determinants of traffic in a network are the network's topology, the flow of the traffic, and the type of the traffic. The graphical visualizations presented here ensure that the available data can be interpreted from all three of these perspectives. Moreover, the underlying idea of our design is that better insight into the activity in the network can be gained by combining these perspectives.

$\to$: Each visualisation was chosen to fill a specfic purpose.  The Heat Map visualisation fills the need to gain a very quick impression of overall network load and size.  The Activity Groups visualisation provides the same information on a server-by-sever basis, providing more data at the expense of simplicity.  The Dataflow visualisation provides the ability to see what packets currently coming over the network 'look' like, and the Spinning Cube and Attribute Distribution visualisations allow the user specify which apects of the packets are shown.

As such, no two visualisations fill the same role, each providing something that is not found in any of the others.  However, to get a complete understanding of the network no one visualisation will suffice - it is the combination of these complementary visualisations that makes the application unique.
