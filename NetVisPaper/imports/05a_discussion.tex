The main determinants of traffic in a network are the network's topology, the flow of the traffic, and the type of the traffic. The graphical visualizations presented here ensure that the available data can be interpreted from all three of these perspectives. Moreover, the underlying idea of our design is that better insight into the activity in the network can be gained by combining these perspectives.
