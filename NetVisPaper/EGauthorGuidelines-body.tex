\begin{abstract}
Computer network traffic visualizations attempts to deliver improved understanding of traffic on a network to an observer. 
Many existing tools opt for graph or plot-based visualizations to detect patterns or outliers in the data, but still largely
provide a segmented view of any data feed. In this paper, we present a novel network traffic visualization framework that 
makes use of a variety of complementary visualizations to obtain better situational awareness. 
Our proposed solution is to look at different.. {\color{red}more}

\section{Introduction}
{\color{red}JH: A few guidelines to writing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item No need to mention this is a student group paper as this is being submitted to a research conference. The editors will know because we have to sign up as a student paper (there is a best student paper prize), but the reviewers won't know.
  \item Keep your language as formal as possible: Avoid 'I' and limit the use of 'we'. No banter or double-ententres. Text should be clear and concise.
  \item Pseudo-code/Maths is welcomed if needed. Typesetting using the program package: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Algorithms
  \item No references in the abstract. No footnotes in the paper.
  \item Other general EG paper writing guidelines can be found below (commented out).
  \item Conference submission guidelines: http://www.eguk.org.uk/TPCG13/submission/submission.html
  \item JH will submit the final copy of the paper.
  \item JH: Better title is welcomed if you have one! :)
\end{itemize}

% \section{Instructions}
% 
% Please follow the steps outlined in this document very carefully when
% submitting your manuscript to Eurographics.
% 
% You may as well use the \LaTeX\ source as a template to typeset your own
% paper. In this case we encourage you to also read the \LaTeX\ comments
% embedded in the document.
% 
% Please read the following carefully.
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Language}
% 
% All manuscripts must be in English.
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Margins and page numbering}
% 
% All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts,
% must be kept within a print area 6.31 inches (16.03 cm) wide by
% 9.10 inches (23.13 cm) high. Do not write or print anything
% outside the print area. Number your pages on odd sites right
% above, on even sites left above, no page number on the first site.
% Do not use page numbering within the final version of your paper.
% 
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Formatting your paper}
% 
% All text with the exception of the abstract must be in a two-column format.
% The total allowable width of the text area -- including header and footer
% lines -- is 161\,mm (6.34 inch) wide by 231\,mm (9.10 inch) high.
% 
% Columns are to be 76\,mm (3.0 inch) wide, with a 8\,mm (0.315 inch) space 
% between them.
% 
% The space between the header line and the first line of the text body and
% between the last line of the text body and the footer line is 5\,mm
% (0.196 inch) each.
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Type-style and fonts}
% 
% Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If
% neither is available on your word processor, please use the font
% closest in appearance to Times that you have access to. Only
% Type-1 fonts will be accepted.
% 
% MAIN TITLE. The title should be in Times 17-point, boldface type and
% centered. Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives,
% and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
% prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
% lines after the title.
% 
% AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title and
% printed in Times 9-point, non-boldface type. This information is to be
% followed by two blank lines.
% 
% The ABSTRACT ist to be in a one-column format. The MAIN TEXT is to be in a
% two-column format.
% 
% MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 9-point Times, single-spaced. Do \emph{not} use
% double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 em (the length of the
% dash in the actual font). Make sure your text is fully justified -- that is,
% flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank lines
% between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be 9-point Times
% boldface type as in Figure~\ref{fig:firstExample}.
% 
% \noindent Long captions should be set as in Figure~\ref{fig:ex1} or
% Figure~\ref{fig:ex3}.
% 
% \begin{figure}[htb]
%    % an empty figure just consisting of the caption lines
%    \caption{\label{fig:ex1}
%      'Empty' figure only to serve as an example of long caption requiring 
%      more than one line. It is not typed centered but aligned on both sides.}
% \end{figure}
% 
% \noindent
% Figures which need the full textwidth can be typeset as Figure~\ref{fig:ex3}.
% 
% \noindent Callouts should be 9-point Times, non-boldface type. Initially
% capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and
% third-order headings.
% 
% FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, \textbf{1. Introduction}) should be Times
% 9-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line
% before, and one blank line after.
% 
% SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, \textbf{2.1. Language}) should be Times
% 9-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line
% before, and one after. If you require a third-order heading (we discourage
% it), use 9-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded
% by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.
% 
% The headline \emph{(authors / title)} must be shortened if it uses the full 
% two column width of the main text.
% There must be enough space for the page numbers. Please use ``et al.'' if 
% there are more than three authors and specify a shortened version for your title.
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Footnotes}
% 
% Please do \emph{not} use footnotes at all!
% 
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{References}
% 
% List all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the
% end of your paper in alphabetical order. When referenced in the text, enclose
% the citation index in square brackets, for example~\cite{Lous90}. Where
% appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
% 
% For your references please use the following algorithm:
% \begin{itemize} 
% \item \textbf{one} author: first 3 chars plus year -- 
%       e.g.\ \cite{Lous90}
% \item \textbf{two}, \textbf{three} or \textbf{four} authors: first char
%       of each family name plus year --  e.g.\ \cite{Fellner-Helmberg93} 
%       or \cite{Kobbelt97-USHDR} or \cite{Lafortune97-NARF}
% \item \textbf{more than 4} authors: first char of family name from 
%       first 3 authors followed by a '*' followed by the year -- 
%       e.g.\ \cite{Buhmann:1998:DCQ} or \cite{FolDamFeiHug.etal93} 
% \end{itemize}
% 
% For BibTeX users a style file \ \texttt{eg-alpha.bst} \ is available which
% uses the above algorithm.
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}
% 
% All graphics should be centered.

%   % the following command controls the width of the embedded PS file
%   % (relative to the width of the current column)
%   \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{sampleFig}
%   % replacing the above command with the one below will explicitly set
%   % the bounding box of the PS figure to the rectangle (xl,yl),(xh,yh).
%   % It will also prevent LaTeX from reading the PS file to determine
%   % the bounding box (i.e., it will speed up the compilation process)

%   %
%   \parbox[t]{.9\columnwidth}{\relax
%            For all figures please keep in mind that you \textbf{must not}
%            use images with transparent background!

%   %
%   \caption{\label{fig:firstExample}
%            Here is a sample figure.}
% \end{figure}
% 
% If your paper includes images, it is very important that they are of
% sufficient resolution to be faithfully reproduced.
% 
% To determine the optimum size (width and height) of an image, measure
% the image's size as it appears in your document (in millimeters), and
% then multiply those two values by 12. The resulting values are the
% optimum $x$ and $y$ resolution, in pixels, of the image. Image quality
% will suffer if these guidelines are not followed.
% 
% Example 1: 
% %
% An image measures 50\,mm by 75\,mm when placed in a document. This
% image should have a resolution of no less than 600 pixels by 900
% pixels in order to be reproduced faithfully.
% 
% Example 2: 
% %
% Capturing a screenshot of your entire $1024 \times 768$ pixel display
% monitor may be useful in illustrating a concept from your research. In
% order to be reproduced faithfully, that $1024 \times 768$ image should
% be no larger than 85 mm by 64 mm (approximately) when placed in your
% document.
% 
% 
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Color}
% 
% \textbf{Please observe:} as of 2003 publications in the proceedings of the
% Eurographics Conference can use color images throughout the paper. No
% separate color tables are necessary.
% 
% However, workshop proceedings might have different agreements! 
% Figure~\ref{fig:ex3} is an example for creating color plates.
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Embedding of Hyperlinks / Typesetting of URLs}
% 
% Due to the use of the package \texttt{hyperref} the original behavior
% of the command $\backslash$\texttt{url} from the package \texttt{url}
% is not available. To circumvent this problem we either recommend to
% use the command $\backslash$\texttt{httpAddr} from the 
% included package \texttt{egweblnk} (see below) or to replace the
% command $\backslash$\texttt{url} by the command $\backslash$\texttt{webLink} 
% -- e.g. in cases where $\backslash$\texttt{url} has been used
% widely in BibTeX-References. In the latter case we suggest to run
% BibTeX as usual and then replace all occurences of $\backslash$\texttt{url}  by
% $\backslash$\texttt{webLink}
% 
% \noindent
% The provided commands for hyperlinks, in a nutshell, are:
% 
% \begin{description} \itemsep 1ex
% \item [\webLinkFont $\backslash$httpAddr \{URL without leading 'http:'\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \httpAddr{//diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS}
% 
% \item[\webLinkFont $\backslash$ftpAddr \{URL without leading 'ftp:'\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \ftpAddr{//www.eg.org/EG/DL/ftpupload}
% 
% \item[\webLinkFont $\backslash$URL \{url\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \URL{http://www.eg.org/EG/DL/WS}
% 
% \item[\webLinkFont $\backslash$MailTo \{Email addr\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \MailTo{publishing@eg.org}
% 
% \item[\webLinkFont $\backslash$MailToNA \{emailName\}\{@emailSiteAddress\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \MailToNA{publishing}{@eg.org}
% 
% \item[\webLinkFont $\backslash$webLink\{URL without hyperlink creation\}]
%       \mbox{}\\
%       e.g. \  \webLink{http://www.eg.org/some_arbitrary_long/but_useless/URL}
% 
% \end{description}
% 
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{PDF Generation}
% 
% Your final paper should be delivered as a PDF document with all typefaces
% embedded. \LaTeX{} users should use \texttt{dvips} and \texttt{ps2pdf} to
% create this PDF document. Adobe Acrobat Distiller may be used in place of
% \texttt{ps2pdf}.
% 
% Adobe PDFWriter is \emph{not} acceptable for use. Documents created with
% PDFWriter will be returned to the author for revision. \texttt{pdftex} and
% \texttt{pdflatex} (and its variants) can be used only if the author can
% make certain that all typefaces are embedded and images are not downsampled
% or subsampled during the PDF creation process.
% 
% Users with no access to these PDF creation tools should make available a
% PostScript file and we will make a PDF document from it.
% 
% 
% The PDF file \emph{must not} be change protected.
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: dvips / ps2pdf / etc.}
% 
% \noindent
% \texttt{dvips} should be invoked with the \texttt{-Ppdf} and \texttt{-G0}
% flags in order to use Type 1 PostScript typefaces:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
%     dvips -t a4 -Ppdf -G0 -o my.ps my.dvi
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% 
% \noindent
% If you are using version 7.x of GhostScript, please use the following method of invoking \texttt{ps2pdf}, in
% order to embed all typefaces and ensure that images are not downsampled or subsampled in the PDF
% creation process:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
%   ps2pdf -dMaxSubsetPct=100 \
%          -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 \
%          -dSubsetFonts=true \
%          -dEmbedAllFonts=true \
%          -dAutoFilterColorImages=false \
%          -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \
%          -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          -dMonoImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% 
% If you are using version 8.x of GhostScript, please use this method in place of the example above:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress \
%          -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 \
%          -dAutoFilterColorImages=false \
%          -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \
%          -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          -dMonoImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
%          -dDownsampleColorImages=false \
%          -dDownsampleGrayImages=false \
%          mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: pdftex / pdflatex / etc.}
% 
% \noindent
% Configuration of these tools to embed all typefaces can be accomplished by editing the \texttt{updmap.cfg} file
% to enable inclusion of the standard (or base) 14 typefaces.
% 
% Linux users can run the \texttt{updmap} script to do this:
% \begin{verbatim}
% updmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% Windows users should edit the \texttt{updmap.cfg} files found in their TeX installation directories (one or both
% of the following may be present):
% \begin{verbatim}
%   INSTALLDIR\texmf\web2c\updmap.cfg
%   INSTALLDIR\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% Ensure the value for \texttt{pdftexDownloadBase14} is "true," and then follow the instructions found here:
% \httpAddr{//docs.miktex.org/manual/} to update your MikTeX installation.
% 
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsubsection*{Configuration Notes: Acrobat Distiller}
% 
% We recommend to download and install the version of the ``CMW'' Adobe Acrobat Distiller job options file
% appropriate for your operating system and version of Acrobat from the following URL:
% 
% \httpAddr{//www.cadmusmediaworks.com/index2.html}\\
% in the ``(Operating System)/Applications/Distiller Settings'' folder. The ``CMW'' job options file embeds
% all typefaces and does not downsample or subsample images when creating the PDF document.
% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Copyright forms}
% 
% You must include your signed Eurographics copyright release form
% when you submit your finished paper. We MUST have this form before
% your paper can be published in the proceedings.
