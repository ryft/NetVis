Computer network traffic visualizations deliver improved understanding of traffic on a network to an observer. 
Many existing tools opt for graph or plot-based visualizations to detect patterns or outliers in the data, but they still largely
provide a segmented view of any data feed. In this paper, we present a novel network traffic visualization framework that 
makes use of a variety of complementary visualizations to obtain better situational awareness. Our proposed solution NetVis provides 
six different visualizations that work in tandem to provide situational awareness of the network traffic passing through. Three of 
the visualizations are based on existing literature (parallel coordinate plots, flowscan and spinning cube of potential doom), whereas the 
three remaining visualizations are novel to this paper. Our results show that it is possible to use the tool to detect unusual activity 
and cyber attacks on a network. The framework is written in a way that allows future visualizations to be straightforwardly added.
