Our main avenue of future work is a more powerful data preprocessing system. Our current visualizations focus on giving the user a complete view on the network while allowing interactive filtering. However, if statistical inference is applied to the data and historical observations are incorporated, visualizations can be more effective in pointing out suspicious patterns and anomalies.

Future work should need to validate the usefulness of our application by testing it on other expert users in live environments instead of laboratory settings only.
