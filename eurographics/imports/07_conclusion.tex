We have presented a network visualization tool to analyse and monitor network traffic. Instead of presenting single perspectives (visualizations) of the data very well (but with a limited scope), our framework delivers a variety of visualizations that complement each other and work in tandem to help an analyst obtain improved awareness of ongoing network activity through user interaction. We overviewed its suite of visualizations and demonstrated its usefulness with example scenarios. In the future we intend to add more visualizations and further improve the tool's usability.
